Install prereqs:

sudo dnf install libvirt qemu-kvm

Then, enable libvirt and load the KVM kernel module:

sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
sudo systemctl enable --now virtlogd

echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/module/kvm/parameters/ignore_msrs

sudo modprobe kvm

cd <path to store disk image at>
cd /var/lib/libvirt/images
qemu-img create -f qcow2 maindisk.qcow2 128G

run the initial container to generate the boot disk et all

- when greeted with the system recovery menu, enter disk utility and erase the largest disk ~ 137gb as APFS or maybe MacOS extended (Journaled) depending on which spin of osx. then close out of disk utility.
- 'reinstall macOS <version>' choosing the disk you just nuked then wait for 45 minutes or so.
- when greeted with the desktop, log in and test an imessage to self. rinse and refresh.
-  before rebooting pull the bootdisk out of the container volume (sudo) docker cp osx:/home/arch/OSX-KVM/OpenCore/OpenCore.qcow2 /var/lib/libvirt/images/bootdisk.qcow2
- then uncomment / change the compose file and image to match where you wired everything up.

Additional boot instructions for when you are creating your container

    Boot the macOS Base System (Press Enter)

    Click Disk Utility

    Erase the BIGGEST disk (around 200gb default), DO NOT MODIFY THE SMALLER DISKS. -- if you can't click erase, you may need to reduce the disk size by 1kb

    (optional) Create a partition using the unused space to house the OS and your files if you want to limit the capacity. (For Xcode 12 partition at least 60gb.)

    Click Reinstall macOS

    The system may require multiple reboots during installation
